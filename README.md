## About TLCVerse

In line with the United Nations SDG goals, we aim to tackle the problem of poor
quality of education by creating a platform that not only teaches students but
allows healthy and interactive competition between them to improve the
educational environment. The application will help students who are preparing
for major qualification exams and serve as a valuable tool for their learning.
